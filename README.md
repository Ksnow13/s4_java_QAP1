1. A doubly linked list can be utilized to implement a browser history feature.
Each URL visited is stored as a node in the list, with the “next” pointer representing the forward navigation and the “previous” pointer representing the backward navigation.
Implement a browser history to allow users to easily navigate through their browsing history by following the links to the list. In your main, show the working of your implementation.

2. A doubly linked list can be employed to implement a text editor’s buffer. 
Each node in the list represents a line of text, allowing efficient insertion, 
deletion and editing operations. The “next” and “previous” pointers enable easy navigation and traversal of the lines, 
facilitating functionalities like moving the cursor up/down or left/right within the text. Implement a text editor.
